Syncing
======================================================================

Syncing of your notes is important to have
* a backup if your laptop crashes and 
* your actual notes on your private and work computers. 

Because all stuff are normal files you can and should sync them with your preferred cloud tool like: 
* Dropbox
* Google
* OneDrive
* Apple Cloud

If you know how to use [git](/coding/git/README.md) you should use this, to integrate the additional [revising process](/coding/git/note-quality.md).  


The Settings of VS Code should be synced with the build-in tools of [VS Code](/coding/editors/vs-code/settings-sync.md).  


Cell Phones
------------------------------------------------------------
Syncing your files on a cell phone might be more complicated, because the default apps only provide links inside their apps and don't creates physical local copies on your phone.
