Workflow New Note
======================================================================

Instant writing
------------------------------------------------------------

If an idea is popping up in your head its important to write it down as [quick as possible](../note-taking/be-fast.md). 
For this I use [Note Macros](/coding/vs-code/plugins/note-macros.md) which opens up directly a new empty file with date stemp. 



Sorted writing
------------------------------------------------------------

If I am in a more structured process of [gaining new knowledge](../processes/howto-attack-new-topics.md), 
I want to create a note inside a specific folder. 
You can create the new markdown file with the right mouse button, or 
you can use the Plugin [Markdown Notes](/coding/vs-code/plugins/markdown-notes.md#new-note)

* Go to a note in the desired folder/category
* Execute `Markdown Notes: New Note` and enter the new title 
* Mark everything and insert the [Snippet](/coding/vs-code/snippets.md) `note header`
* start writing :-)
