Knowledge Base Tools
======================================================================

Beside my actual knowledge base approach with this template there are a lot of other tools in the market.  

* [VS Code](/coding/editors/vs-code/README.md) as Editor  
* [Citavi](citavi.md) was long time my first choice
* [Joplin](joplin.md) my tool for the daily incoming unsorted notes
* From [Obsidian](/coding/editors/obsidian/README.md) I borrowed a lot of ideas
* [roamresearch.com](https://roamresearch.com/)  
* Dendron
* [zettlr.com](https://zettlr.com/)  
* [Notion](notion.md)
* general Wiki-Systems needs to much clicks for small changes
