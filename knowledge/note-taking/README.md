Note-Taking
======================================================================


Benefits of Note-Taking
------------------------------------------------------------

* preserving learned knowledge 
  (see [forgetting curve](../forgetting-curve.md))
* creating new knowledge by sorting your own thoughts through writing/summarizing during the learning process of new fields 
  (see [HowTo Attack new Knowledge](../processes/howto-attack-new-topics.md))
* Have a brain dump
* [rewarding yourself](../processes/rewarding-yourself.md) with "new knowledge/notes" instead of only finding a "Bug" per day :-)  
* building new thoughts/ideas through [connecting notes](../../coding/languages/markdown/links.md) 
  (see [Zettelkasten](./zettelkasten.md))  
* [review literature](../processes/literature-excerpts.md) and excerpt knowledge  
* link your thoughts together and build the basic structure of a strong [thesis](../processes/write-a-thesis.md)
