A Zettelkasten is a method of knowledge management and note-taking that was developed by the sociologist Niklas Luhmann. 
The term "Zettelkasten" is German for "slip box" or "note box". It's a system that allows for the organization and linking of ideas and information in a non-linear fashion.

The Zettelkasten method relies on several key concepts:

1. [**Atomicity**](./atomic-notes.md): Each note in a Zettelkasten should contain one idea or piece of information. 
    This makes it easier to link notes together in a meaningful way.

2. **Linking**: 
    The heart of the Zettelkasten method is the interconnectedness of notes, creating a web of interconnected ideas. 
    This allows for the exploration of complex topics and the discovery of new connections. 
    ([Markdown Links](/coding/languages/markdown/links/README.md))

3. **Indexing**: An index or a system of tags is used to categorize notes and make them easier to find.

4. **Emergent Structure**: Unlike rigid hierarchical structures, a Zettelkasten allows for an emergent, non-linear structure. 
    The connections between notes emerge over time as you create more notes and link them together. 
    This dynamic structure supports creativity and unexpected insights.

5. **Evergreen notes**: Notes in a Zettelkasten are intended to be evergreen, meaning they are continually updated and refined as new information or insights are gained.
    The Zettelkasten method encourages regular **revision** and [**iteration**](iterative-process.md). 
    As you revisit your notes, you can refine them, add new insights, and create additional connections. 
    This iterative process contributes to the ongoing development of your knowledge base.

6. **Fleeting, Literature, and Permanent notes**: These are the three types of notes in the Zettelkasten system. 
    * Fleeting notes are temporary and unprocessed thoughts, 
    * [Literature notes](../processes/literature-excerpts.md) are summaries or insights from reading, and 
    * Permanent notes are refined and interconnected notes that form the main body of the Zettelkasten.


The Zettelkasten method is particularly popular among researchers, writers, and knowledge workers who seek an effective way to capture and organize their thoughts, ideas, and research findings.
