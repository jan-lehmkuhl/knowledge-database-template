Be Quick (or its Dead)
======================================================================

Write your note, before you forget.  
And be so subconscious and so fast, that it not disturbs you from your next thoughts.  

If you achieve this your notes will help you along your thinking process. 
Even if you pick up one of two ends of your thoughts, you will can pick up the other one later, without losing context. 

If your are not quick in doing notes, you are not doing the notes at all.
