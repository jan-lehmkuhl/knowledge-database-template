Write a Thesis
======================================================================

If you writing a thesis you have to break it down into small steps. 

* Prepare small [atomic notes](../note-taking/atomic-notes.md) which you can use later as building blocks
  These notes and ideas can be: 
    * your own thoughts
    * [literature excerpts](literature-excerpts.md) from paper, books, etc 
* Create "map-of-content" notes. 
  The main note contains a table of content, with the chapters. 
  The chapter notes containing the subchapter or the permanent notes with the content. 
  Maybe have a look in the [main README](/README.md) of this repository, which is also more or less a table of content. 
* For the final writing process you take these blocks/excerpts and write the floating on the basis of these notes. 
  But this process is fast if you no longer have to think about the logic.
