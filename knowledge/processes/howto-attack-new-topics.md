HowTo Attack new Topics
======================================================================

If you want to learn a new topic you should instantly start to write notes. 

Even if you only create a new category (folder) with a single note in it, you learned how you can sort and connect the new topic in a wider scope. 
Also with the next statements you write will help you to check if you understand everything, so that you can summarize it in your own words. 
(Compare [Zettelkasten](../zettelkasten/README.md))  

Because it is an [Iterative process](../note-taking/iterative-process.md) you will not finish your research and so its not a good idea to wait till the not coming end. 


Workflow
------------------------------------------------------------
1. find interesting resources (websites, books, etc)  
2. create a new note and if necessary a new category (folder) in your knowledge base
    * Use the [snippet](/coding/vs-code/snippets.md) `note-header`  
3. Store the resources in your note.  
    * Use snippet `Resources URL Link` for URL links
4. Write your notes: 
    * [be fast](../note-taking/be-fast.md)
    * [write for yourself](../note-taking/write-for-yourself.md) 
5. Refactor/Split your notes when they get to long (see [atomic notes](../note-taking/atomic-notes.md))  
6. Revise your notes at best with [git/note-quality](/coding/git/note-quality.md)
