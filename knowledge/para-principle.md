PARA principle
======================================================================

The PARA principle is important to distinguish which information should go into the knowledge base (aka "Resource") and which not.  

* **Project**: 
  A series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline
* **Area of Responsibility**: 
  A sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time
* **Resource**: 
  A topic or theme of ongoing interest
* **Archive**: 
  Inactive items from the other 3 categories


Important for you is to know, where to store your incoming notes. 
You can also use different tools. 
For example: 
* For projects I use separate git projects with notes similar to the resource database. 
  The project management is organized with issues in GitLab.com. 
* My Area of Responsibility are normal files stored on a samba share. 
  This is because most of them are insurances, etc. which I share with my wife. 
* My Resources are stored with this template on GitLab.com 
* My Archive is like the projects. 
  Important is to finalize projects and move the in the Archive, but to extract previous all needed information for the Resources.
