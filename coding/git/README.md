git
======================================================================

Version control is absolute necessary in software projects to maintain an overview of your status and avoid or solve arising errors. 
Git is the defacto standard in version control systems and open-source. 

For this knowledge base git can help us with:  
* syncing the files over multiple computer
* improve the [note quality](note-quality.md) by creating a revising loop.  


For starters read:  
* [first steps](first-steps.md) and  
* [using git](using-git.md).  


I recommend you to track also as much as possible as soon you understanding the basics of git. 
Personally I nearly track everything in git:
* every projects
* the most of my computer settings
* my knowledge base 
* ... 


With this confidence and some other nice features you will change your working style and: 

* try things without fear of breaking things
* revise your changes before doing the next steps, which leads to better projects
* collaborate with colleagues on the same files
