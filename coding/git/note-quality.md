Improve Note Quality by using git
======================================================================

When using [git](README.md) your workflow will change to the better. 
You will add an additional quality control step when committing changes. 
Instead of writing notes directly you will. 

1. Write down your ideas without thinking about grammer, formatting or nice sentences.  
2. Revising and improving the latest unfinished notes.  
3. Stage, commit and push the revised notes.  

This will help you to have only notes of a minimal quality, which you can define for yourself.
