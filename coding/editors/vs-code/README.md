Visual Studio Code
======================================================================

"Visual Studio Code" is a very powerful and versatile file editor, which can be extended to a full "Integrated Development Environment".  

At best dive into [code.visualstudio.com/docs] and understand at least:  
* the [Command Search](command-palette.md) 
* how to [open a workspace](open-folder-as-workspace.md)
* [snippets](snippets.md)
* how to use and create [keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md)
* how to edit [Markdown-Files](../languages/markdown/README.md) and view the rendered view with `Markdown: Open Preview to Side`
