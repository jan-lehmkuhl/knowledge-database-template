Obsidian
======================================================================

Obsidian is a standalone tool to create a knowledge base like this. 
The data is named as "vault" and similar to the here proposed style. 
Only the [markdown links](/coding/languages/markdown/links.md) are stored in Wiki-Link Syntax, which is not in the markdown specification.  

There is also a lot of documentation outside which can help to use this software. 
For example [What is Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian/Obsidian) explains nicely the idea of a network knowledge base.  


A problem might be the commercial use license ([pricing](https://obsidian.md/pricing)). 


Usage
------------------------------------------------------------
All commands you find in Command Search with the shortcut `ctrl+p`.  

Please look also [my default settings](settings.md).  
Here you should also [switch to markdown links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) to ensure compatibility to other systems. 


### Syncing
For [syncing](/knowledge/repository-base/syncing.md) your files, you can use the standard tools for your computers. 

If you willing to pay more, there is also a builtin [syncing option](https://obsidian.md/sync) with which you can use your knowledge base also on your phone with the Obsidian App.  

On iPhones you do not need the payed sync. 
You can use the Apple Cloud and access your data there directly from the Obsidian App.
