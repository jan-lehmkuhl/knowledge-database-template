My Knowledge Base Template
======================================================================

This is my a template for a structured knowledge base to use with widely spread open-source tools.  

I use this approach for nearly all my work and really don't know how to work without it. 
I hope you find some ideas or extend this repository to your personal knowledge home. 



Benefits of Note-Taking
------------------------------------------------------------

Note-Taking is an essential process of knowledge building and also a creativity process.
This template should help you with:

* preserving learned knowledge (see [forgetting curve](/knowledge/forgetting-curve.md))
* creating new knowledge by sorting your own thoughts through writing/summarizing during the learning process of new fields (see [HowTo Attack new Knowledge](/knowledge/processes/howto-attack-new-topics.md))
* [rewarding yourself](/knowledge/processes/rewarding-yourself.md) with "new knowledge/notes" instead of only finding a "Bug" per day :-)  
* building new thoughts/ideas through connecting notes (see [Zettelkasten](/knowledge/zettelkasten/README.md))  
* [review literature](/knowledge/processes/literature-review.md) and excerpt knowledge  
* link your thoughts together and build the basic structure of a strong [thesis](/knowledge/processes/write-a-thesis.md)  



Important Concepts
------------------------------------------------------------

While working in this knowledge base I rely on some basic concepts which helping me to maintain a good structure. 

* [Atomic Notes](knowledge/note-taking/atomic-notes.md)  
* This is Work in Progress ([iterative approach](/knowledge/note-taking/iterative-process.md))  
* [Easy to Change](/coding/concepts/easy-to-change.md)  
* Notes are written in plain text files in [Markdown Syntax](coding/languages/markdown/README.md).  
* Quality control and improvement with [git](coding/git/note-quality.md)  
* [PARA Principle](knowledge/para-principle.md)  
* [Note Content Structure](knowledge/note-taking/content-structure.md)  



Setup & Basic VS Code Usage
------------------------------------------------------------
* [Install VS Code](coding/vs-code/install.md)  
* Get the files of [this repository](https://github.com/jan-lehmkuhl/knowledge-database-template) with: 
    * `Download Zip` and extract the files on your hard-drive or 
    * if you are used to [git](coding/git/README.md) clone this repository and use the additional benefits of git. 
* Open the downloaded file structure in VS Code with the [command](coding/vs-code/command-palette.md) ["File: Open Folder"](coding/vs-code/open-folder-as-workspace.md) and make sure the folder `.vscode` is in your root of your workspace  
* Make sure you are able to insert [snippets](coding/vs-code/snippets.md)  



HowTo Use
------------------------------------------------------------

## Markdown

Die meisten Informationen werden in [Markdown-Files](coding/languages/markdown/README.md) mit der Dateiendung `md` gespeichert. 
Diese Markdown-Dateien kannst du mit einem normalen Texteditor im Quelltext öffnen und lesen. 
Besser ist es aber diese Dateien in gerenderter Ansicht zu betrachten. 
Idealerweise nutzt du dafür den Editor [VS Code](coding/vs-code/README.md)
