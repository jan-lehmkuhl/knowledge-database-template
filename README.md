My Knowledge Base Template
======================================================================

Note-Taking is an essential process of knowledge building and also a creativity process. 
(Benefits listed in [/knowledge/note-taking/README](/knowledge/note-taking/README.md#benefits-of-note-taking))  
This is my a template for a structured knowledge base to use with widely spread open-source tools.  

I use this approach for nearly all my work and really don't know how to work without it. 
I hope you find some ideas or extend this repository to your personal knowledge home. 


Important Concepts
------------------------------------------------------------
The general concept of this template follows the [Zettelkasten-Approach](knowledge/note-taking/zettelkasten.md). 
While working I rely on some basic (additional) concepts which helping me to maintain a good structure. 

* [Atomic Notes](knowledge/note-taking/atomic-notes.md)  
* [Be fast](/knowledge/note-taking/be-fast.md)  
* [Easy to Change](/coding/concepts/easy-to-change.md)  
* This is Work in Progress ([iterative approach](/knowledge/note-taking/iterative-process.md))  
* Notes in plain text files with [Markdown Syntax](coding/languages/markdown/README.md).  
* Quality control and note improvement by revising with [git](coding/git/note-quality.md)  
* [rewarding yourself](../processes/rewarding-yourself.md) with "new knowledge/notes" instead of only finding a "Bug" per day :-)  
* [Daily Notes](knowledge/note-taking/daily-notes.md) as unsorted Inbox.  
* [PARA Principle](knowledge/para-principle.md)  
* [Note Content Structure](knowledge/note-taking/content-structure.md)  



Setup & Basic VS Code Usage
------------------------------------------------------------
* [Install VS Code](coding/editors/vs-code/install.md)  
* Get the files of [this repository](https://github.com/jan-lehmkuhl/knowledge-database-template) with: 
    * `Download Zip` and extract the files on your hard-drive or 
    * if you are used to [git](coding/git/README.md) clone this repository and use the additional benefits of git. 
* Open the downloaded file structure in VS Code with the [command](coding/editors/vs-code/command-palette.md) ["File: Open Folder"](coding/editors/vs-code/open-folder-as-workspace.md) and make sure the folder `.vscode` is in your root of your workspace  
* Make sure you are able to insert [snippets](coding/editors/vs-code/snippets.md)  
* Install some Plugins
* [Syncing files](knowledge/repository-base/syncing.md)  

If you want to have the freedom and configuration of VS Code [Obsidian](coding/editors/obsidian/README.md) as standalone tool, might be an alternative.  



Use it
------------------------------------------------------------
Finally you should use this template to do your beneficial knowledge work by [note taking](/knowledge/note-taking/README.md#benefits-of-note-taking) like:  

* search faster for stuff you forgot 
* [attack new knowledge fields](/knowledge/processes/howto-attack-new-topics.md)
* do [literature work](/knowledge/processes/literature-excerpts.md)
* [create a thesis](/knowledge/processes/write-a-thesis.md) on basis of notes
